# Pupil shift (experimental)

## What it is

`XR_APILAYER_DCSVR_pupil_shift` is an OpenXR API layer. Its source is in `native/pupil_shift/`. It renders each eye from where the pupil really is for the current gaze, instead of from the single fixed eye point the runtime reports.

## Why

When the eye turns, the pupil moves on a sphere around the eye's rotation centre. That sphere has a radius of about 10.5 mm. At 25 degrees of gaze the pupil sits 4.4 mm sideways and 1 mm back.

The runtime renders from a fixed point, so two errors appear when the eyes move without the head:

- Near objects (the cockpit) show a perspective error: about 0.2° at 0.7 m.
- The whole image shifts against the lens's virtual image, which sits at a finite distance: about 0.15° at 25 degrees of gaze.

Together they are the part of "pupil swim" that does not depend on the lens.

## Is the lens itself part of the problem?

`native/pupil_shift/virtual_lens/README.md` studies this with an ensemble of pancake lenses fitted to Pimax's own data. The data was read from the compositor: the distortion curve, a focal length of 16.8 mm, and the chromatic aberration.

If the lens is sharp when the eye turns, its own swim within 25 degrees of gaze is 0.01° ± 0.075°. The geometric correction is therefore the part worth doing, and no lens measurements are needed for it.

Pimax does not do this already:

- Its compositor uses eye tracking only for foveated rendering, the IPD motor and gaze filtering.
- Its distortion is one static object per eye.

The layer's log can confirm this at runtime (see "How to verify in the headset").

## How it works

**Gaze.** The gaze comes from the focus views of a foveated quad-view configuration: their FOV is centred on the gaze. Pimax native Quad Views and the bundled Quad Views both provide this.

There is no gaze in two cases:

- stereo profiles;
- fixed focus.

Without a gaze, the layer does nothing.

**`xrLocateViews`.** For each eye:

- `pose += R_view * radius * (gaze - forward)`;
- the FOV tangents become `(tan - d.xy/D) / (1 + d.z/D)`, where `D` is the virtual image distance.

The same offset in world space is applied to the eye's focus view.

**`xrEndFrame`.** Projection views that still carry the values the layer handed out get the runtime's original pose and FOV back. The match is by display time and value, within 1e-4. The compositor and every layer below see the frame exactly as if the layer were absent; only the rendered content differs.

**Position in the chain.** The layer is first, next to DCS (`layerNames.Insert(0, …)` in `DeploymentPlanner`).

**Settings.** `PupilShift.ini` sits next to the DLL and is re-read about once a second:

- `Enabled`
- `EyeRadiusMm` (default 10.5)
- `VirtualImageM` (default 1.5)
- `MaxGazeDeg` (default 35)
- `SimulateGaze`, `SimulateGazeXDeg`, `SimulateGazeYDeg` (testing)

**Hotkey.** `Toggle` in `PupilShift.ini` (virtual-key:modifiers, Ctrl 1, Alt 2, Shift 4; default 121:5, Ctrl+Shift+F10; 0:0 off) turns the correction off and on in flight. The modifiers must match exactly. A low beep means off; a high beep means on. The app records it like its other in-flight keys and refuses a combination another switch uses.

**Status.** `PupilShift_Status()`, exported by the layer, is read by OFXR's diagnostic panel (patch 0015): bit 0 running, bit 1 correction on, bit 2 a gaze applied in the last second, bit 3 simulated gaze, bit 4 runtime poses given back, bits 8-15 the largest shift in 0.1 mm. The panel shows "Pupil shift: ON, 3.2 mm", "no gaze" or "OFF (Ctrl+Shift+F10)"; `DCSVR_PUPIL_HOTKEY` names the key.

**Log.** `PupilShift.log` sits next to the DLL. Once a second it writes:

- frames and how many were shifted;
- the gaze range;
- the maximum shift;
- how many projection views were given back to the runtime with its own poses (`restored=`);
- the runtime's own left-eye position relative to the head.

If that last value moved with the gaze, the runtime would already be shifting the eye itself.

## Profile and app

| Area | What exists |
|---|---|
| Profile (`VrProfile`) | `PupilShift` (off by default), `PupilShiftEyeRadiusMm` (5–15), `PupilShiftVirtualImageM` (0.5–5). `UsesPupilShift` needs a VR flight with Quad Views and an eye-tracked gaze. |
| Validation | `pupil-radius` and `pupil-image` are errors. `pupil-gaze` is a warning: the layer is on but the profile has no gaze, so it is not installed. |
| Deployment | `profiles/<id>/pupilshift/` holds the DLL, `PupilShift.ini` and the log. The manifest is `layers/pupil-shift.json`. `ControlService` verifies `components/pupilshift/XR_APILAYER_DCSVR_pupil_shift.dll` against its `.sha256`. |
| Release | `scripts/build-pupil-shift.ps1` builds the layer and runs the geometry tests. `build-release.ps1` copies the DLL and its hash into `components/pupilshift`. `verify-web-release.py` treats it as a rebuilt component. |
| UI | Its own page, **Pupil shift**, marked experimental: toggle, eye radius, image distance, in-flight switch; a note with a link when the profile has no eye-tracked gaze; the status from `PupilShift.log` (`PupilShiftStatus`): gaze range over the flight, largest shift, seconds with a gaze, whether the runtime's poses were given back, and warnings (gaze that barely moves; a runtime that moves the eye itself). |
| Tests | "Pupil shift is deployed first in the layer chain …" in `tests/DcsVr.Tests`, and `pupil_shift_tests` (CTest). |

## Open points

- **Real-headset check.** Not yet tested in DCS. To check:
  - the Pimax focus FOV follows the gaze without too much lag or clamping;
  - `end_frame: restored N projection views` appears in the log.
- **Compositor reprojection.** Checked statically, with a low risk: the compositor cannot undo the correction.
  - It receives the very poses it reported, so its timewarp does exactly what it does without the layer.
  - Its timewarp is the Oculus-style rotational warp (`EyeRenderD3D11PoseWarp`, `NdcToTimewarpLerpScale`). A rotational warp has no positional or depth term, so it cannot reverse a translation in any case.
  - Smart Smoothing works on the images themselves, so it carries the corrected content along.

  Quick sanity check: set `SimulateGaze=1`, `SimulateGazeXDeg=25` and `EyeRadiusMm=30` while DCS runs. The near cockpit should visibly shift against the outside. Restore the values afterwards.
- **Gaze lag.** The focus area may be smoothed by Pimax (`eye_tracking_low_pass_alpha`).
- **Beyond 25 degrees of gaze.** The lens part is not determinable there, so only geometry is corrected; `MaxGazeDeg` clamps at 35.
